                <h4>1. Live Share</h4>
                <ul>
                    In order to work on our project together, we had to use the function called "Live Share." However, this function on VSCode is not very user friendly. To work the "Live Share" function, the person who first created the file for the code must "start the live session." The other peers who are trying to work on the project can only work on it IF the main user is online.
                </ul>
                <ul>
                    Another problem with the "Live Share" function is that, if the session starter's laptop dies or the tab with the code closes, we have to keep resending a new link to work on it. It doesn't sound like much of a problem but once you have to continuously have to keep repeating the same step, it becomes a burden. Working on a code with someone is harder than what we imagined it to be. It would be useful if VSCode had a function that would allow users to add another user's email to allow for easier cooperation.
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Confusing Terms</h4>
                <ul>
                    Our project required us using different coding languages that we haven't previously learned. Specific terms in one language will be differnet or wouldn't work for another language. This forced us to do a lot more research into how to solve a specific problem or how to implement a specific function/design.
                </ul>

                <h4> Getting Stuck</h4>
                <ul>
                    Sometimes we would get a certain idea for a change to the website but not know how to write a code for it. We would have to do extra research to find the answer or just do trial and error until we figured it out
                </ul>
