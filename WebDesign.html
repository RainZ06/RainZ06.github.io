            <h4>1. Websites should be easily readable </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Most users will not read through a whole website. They should be able to spot the information that they are looking for at a glance. </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>2. More is less</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Unnecessary elements will only clutter the space and confuse users. A website should be kept simple for best effect</li>
            </ul>

            <h4> 3. Follow popular conventions </h4>
            <ul>
            <li>Most web designers follow conventions that users have learned to expect from websites. Websites that follow popular conventions are easier for users to intuitively navigate</li>
                </ul>

            <h4>1. Essential Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> We learned about the essential features that most modern websites have, such as navigation menus and headlines </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>2. Took inspiration from other websites</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> We examined existing websites to see how professionals design websites </li>
